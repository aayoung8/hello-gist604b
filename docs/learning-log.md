# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** [Alexandra Young]  
**Date:** [10-25-25]

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- [How to create new folders]
- [That I can click on the brown button after I make a commit to see what things are pending]
- [A much better understanding of the different types of files in a Github repository]

## Challenges and Solutions
[My biggest challenge was learning a new platform. I've never seen a site like this. Working through this assignment slowly and intentionally has vastly expanding my udnerstanding of repositories.]

## Connection to My GIS Career
[GitHub is an important tool for sharing data. Being able to work in this format not only porovides valuable documentation for my career, it also teaches me what to expect with communicating, collaborating, and finding information on GitHub.]

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
